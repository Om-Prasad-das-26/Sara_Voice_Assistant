Sara :- The Personal Voice Assistant

This voice assistant is a Python-based application that allows users to interact with their computer through voice commands. It utilizes various Python libraries such as SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, and smtplib to recognize voice inputs, generate text-to-speech output, and send emails. Users can perform tasks such as opening applications, searching the web, playing music, and sending emails by simply speaking commands. The application is designed to be extensible, with additional functionality easily added through the use of additional Python libraries or by adding custom code. It provides a convenient and hands-free way to perform tasks on a computer, making it an ideal tool for people with disabilities or those who prefer a more natural user interface.
